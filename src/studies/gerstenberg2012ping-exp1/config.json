A player neither gets stronger nor weaker between games.\n\nHowever, each player has a certain chance of being lazy in any given game. If a player decides to be lazy, then that player doesn't pull with all their strength. For example, it's possible that PW pulled with all his strength in Game 1 but decided to be lazy in Game 2.\n\nA team's strength is determined by the sum of the strengths of its players. The team with the greater overall strength wins the game.\n\nWe will ask you a few test questions to check that you've understood how everything works."
