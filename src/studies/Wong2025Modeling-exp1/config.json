For example, in the tournament shown below, Peter and Matthew competed against Jacob and Anthony in Game 1. <b>The crown indicates which team won the game.</b> Here, Peter and Matthew won against Jacob and Anthony. <br><br> In Game 2, Jacob won the game against Peter. <br><br> Note that <b>a player's strength remains constant</b> throughout a tournament. For example, Peter was equally strong in Game 1 and in Game 2. A player neither gets stronger nor weaker between games. <br><br> However, <b>each player can decide how much effort to put into each game.</b> A player may put in low effort, high effort, or a normal amount of effort in a game. For example, it's possible that Peter put in high effort in Game 1 but low effort in Game 2. <br><br>The pulling power of a team depends on the strength of its players, and how much effort each player puts into the game. The team with the greater pulling power wins the game. <br><br>Note that we will show you a new set of players in each tournament."
